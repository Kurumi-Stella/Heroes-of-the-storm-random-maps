# Heroes of the Storm Random Maps
Some random map files made by KurumiStella, Either for the KEKWs or testing

The maps currently are:

| Map Name | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dehaka With Spawn Brush | [DehakaWithSpawnBrush.stormmap](maps/DehakaWithSpawnBrush.stormmap) | Regular Dehaka, but with an extra ability to spawn a brush anywhere! You can Brushstalk (Z), get movement speed, etc, anywhere you like! |
| Deckard With Drawing | [DeckardWithDrawing.stormmap](maps/DeckardWithDrawing.stormmap) | Regular Deckard, but with an extra ability to freely draw any area and apply the Scroll of Sealing Effect to it. I call it the *Scroll of Freedom*! |

# Loading the maps

There are two ways to load the custom map:

- Replacing the in game try mode (better):
  - Go to your heroes of the storm installation directory (assuming `C:\Program Files\Heroes of the Storm`)
  - Create a folder named `maps`
  - Then go in `maps` and create a folder named `heroes`
  - Then go in `heroes` and create a folder named `singleplayermaps`
  - Then go in `singleplayermaps`.
  - Copy the downloaded map file (`.stormmap`) and put it into here.
  - Rename the map to `(10)trymemode.stormmap`
  - Now you should have the map file located in `C:\Program Files\Heroes of the Storm\maps\heroes\singleplayermaps\(10)trymemode.stormmap`
  - Finally, open your game, and launch the try mode.
  - You should see the map loaded.
  - If you would like to remove this custom try mode, simply delete the `(10)trymemode.stormmap` file, or the whole `maps` folder.
- Directly open the map:
  - This method is easier and more convinent but it will cause talents not be loaded/level not scaled and other weird stuff happens, so it is not recommended.
  - Double click on the download map file. Windows will ask for "How to open this map". Scroll to the bottom, and select "Look for another app". Now select the `HeroesSwitcher_x64.exe`, which is located at `"C:\Program Files\Heroes of the Storm\Support64\HeroesSwitcher_x64.exe"`, assuming you installed Heroes of the Storm in `C:\Program Files\Heroes of the Storm`. Click on "OK" and you will now able to launch the map.
